# Incorrect State Update in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `useEffect` hook in React 19: directly modifying state variables instead of using the setter function.  This leads to unexpected behavior because React's state management system doesn't detect the change, therefore not triggering a re-render.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation. The state variable `count` is directly incremented, which doesn't trigger a re-render in React.  The second `setCount` call is redundant and inefficient since the `count` value is not updated in React's state management system. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file corrects the error by using the `setCount` function to update the `count` state. This ensures React properly updates the UI, resolving the unexpected behavior.
